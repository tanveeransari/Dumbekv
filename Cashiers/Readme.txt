Projects in Solution
=====================
Cashiers -		interface to command line input and output. Runs the logic using CashiersLib
CashiersLib -	this is where all the heavy lifting is done. Contains all the business logic. 
CashierTests -	unit tests for CashiersLib 

Assumptions
==================
Desirable attributes are readability/maintainability and object oriented design and testability. 
I would have done this differently if performance was the objective.

Class variable naming with an underscore prefix is okay, as is not the "this." prefix for all class members.
This is only one of several possible coding conventions.
